# 🎯 Cursor/Composer Usage Guide

## Understanding Auto vs Manual Mode

### 🤖 Auto Mode
**What it does:**
- Automatically accepts and applies my suggestions
- Faster workflow - less clicking "Accept"
- I still show you what I'm doing
- You can still review changes before committing

**Best for:**
- ✅ Small fixes and improvements
- ✅ Documentation updates
- ✅ Code formatting
- ✅ Simple refactoring
- ✅ Routine tasks

**You still have control:**
- Can undo changes (Ctrl+Z)
- Can reject specific suggestions
- Can review in Git before committing
- Can switch back to Manual anytime

### ✋ Manual Mode
**What it does:**
- Shows you each change before applying
- You click "Accept" for each suggestion
- More control over each step
- Better for learning/reviewing

**Best for:**
- ✅ Major feature additions
- ✅ Architecture changes
- ✅ When you want to understand each step
- ✅ Critical code changes

## 💰 Being Reasonable with Usage

### Understanding Limits
Cursor/Composer typically has:
- **Daily limits** - Resets each day
- **Monthly limits** - Based on your plan
- **Per-request limits** - Some operations cost more

### 🎯 Smart Usage Strategies

#### 1. **Batch Similar Tasks**
Instead of:
- ❌ "Fix typo in README"
- ❌ "Fix typo in CONSOLIDATION.md"
- ❌ "Fix typo in MIGRATION_GUIDE.md"

Do:
- ✅ "Fix typos in all markdown files"

#### 2. **Use Auto for Routine Work**
- ✅ Small fixes → Auto mode
- ✅ Documentation → Auto mode
- ✅ Formatting → Auto mode

#### 3. **Use Manual for Big Changes**
- ✅ New features → Manual mode (review each step)
- ✅ Refactoring → Manual mode (understand changes)
- ✅ Bug fixes → Manual mode (verify fixes)

#### 4. **Plan Your Sessions**
- **Morning:** Big features (Manual mode)
- **Afternoon:** Small fixes (Auto mode)
- **Evening:** Documentation (Auto mode)

## 🚀 For Your Consolidation Project

### What We've Accomplished (Low Usage!)
We did A LOT in one session:
- ✅ Ported 5 major features
- ✅ Fixed all errors
- ✅ Created documentation
- ✅ Optimized code

**This was efficient because:**
- We worked in batches
- I did multiple things per request
- You accepted changes efficiently

### Going Forward

#### ✅ Use Auto Mode For:
1. **Testing fixes** - "Fix the bug in TaskManagement"
2. **Documentation** - "Update README with new feature"
3. **Small improvements** - "Add error handling here"
4. **Code cleanup** - "Remove unused imports"

#### ✋ Use Manual Mode For:
1. **New features** - "Add authentication system"
2. **Major refactoring** - "Restructure the services folder"
3. **When learning** - "Explain how this works"

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. **Be Specific**
❌ "Fix stuff"
✅ "Fix the localStorage error in IdeaLab.tsx line 45"

### 2. **Batch Requests**
❌ Multiple small requests
✅ "Fix all TypeScript errors in the components folder"

### 3. **Review Before Committing**
- Always review changes in Git
- Test before committing
- Use "Undo" if something's wrong

### 4. **Use Auto Wisely**
- Auto = Trust me with small stuff
- Manual = You want to review each step
- Switch modes as needed!

## 🎯 Recommended Workflow

### For Your Project Right Now:

1. **Test Features** (Manual - you're learning)
   - Use TEST_CHECKLIST.md
   - Ask questions as you go
   - Review each feature

2. **Fix Issues** (Auto - routine fixes)
   - "Fix the bug where..."
   - "Add error handling to..."
