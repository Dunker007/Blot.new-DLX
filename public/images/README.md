# Background Image Instructions

## HUD Image Setup

The DLX Command Center HUD background requires an image file to be placed in this directory.

### Required File

**File Name:** `dlx-command-center-hud.png`  
**Location:** `public/images/dlx-command-center-hud.png`

### Image Specifications

- **Format:** PNG (with transparency preferred)
- **Resolution:** Recommended 1920x1080 or higher (will scale to fit)
- **Content:** The DLX COMMAND CENTER LUX 2.0 TURBO HUD image you provided

### Fallback

If the image file is not found, the system will automatically use CSS gradient fallbacks that approximate the HUD aesthetic.

### How to Add

1. Place your HUD image file in this directory (`public/images/`)
2. Name it exactly: `dlx-command-center-hud.png`
3. Refresh the application - the image will load automatically

The CSS is already configured to use this image with appropriate opacity and blend modes for visibility.
